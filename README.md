Infrequently Changing CCHDO Metadata
====================================
Has the following metadata sets:

* Parameter Names/Descriptions
* Ship/platform codes
* ISO Alpha-2 and ISO Alpha-3 country codes

Project contains the canonical set of parameters used by CCHDO for data
processing, the parameter list in the exchange documentation is
automatically generated from this data. The internal processing software
also uses this data.

This project also contains the ICES ship codes used to generate
expocodes from ship names. The ship name could be determined from the
expocode as well (by using this data).

The metadata are in JSON formats with a specific structure described
here.
